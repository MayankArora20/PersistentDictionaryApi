# PersistentDictionaryApi
This project is part of Happiest Minds Coding Challenge at TechGig. 
Technologies used for this API are Java Spring Boot, Java Spring MVC, JPA, JSP and MySQL. 
H2 can be used in place of MySQL but that will not keep the dictionary persistent whenever we restart the application. 
A separate Repository with H2 is:  "https://github.com/MayankArora20/PersistentDictionaryApiUsingH2db/tree/master"
